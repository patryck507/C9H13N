# C9H13N
C9H13N - is a lightweight opensource CS:GO external cheat base which supports lots of features and is well commented.

# About
C9H13N - is an external base.
Since its public, I strongly recommend to make your own features and pack it, you can also use ```PROCESS_VM_READ``` instead of ```ALL_ACCESS``` and only read from the game to make it safer. you have to simulate the input then because you cant write to the game anymore.

- Compile in x86
